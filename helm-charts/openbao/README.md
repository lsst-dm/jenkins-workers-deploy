# OpenBao Guide

This repository contains the configuration and operational procedures for Openbao, an open-source credentials manager forked from Hashicorp Vault.

## Unsealing the Vault

If the Openbao pod is in a `Running` state but shows `0/1` ready, it is likely sealed. While sealed, the vault is encrypted and cannot serve requests to Jenkins, breaking Jenkins runs. The macs will also be unable to connect to Jenkins.

### 1. Check Sealed Status
Exec into the pod to verify the current status:
```bash
kubectl exec -it <openbao-pod-name> -n vault-openbao -- sh
bao status
``` 
This will show if the pod is initialized but sealed.
### 2. Unseal the Vault
Unseal the vault:
```bash
bao operator unseal
```
Use the unseal keys listed in `vault-creds` in GSM when prompted, you will have to do the command three times for the three keys. Do `bao status` at the end to check if vault is now unsealed. The pod should now be in a `Running` `1/1` state.
